# Steps to create a repository

1. Create a folder to keep project in
2. Create a README.md file
3. We `git add .` in order to stage files to be commited
4. we `git commit -m "initial commit"` to create initial commit
5. We go to github.com/new to create a new repository
6. We then clicked on the clipboard with the ssh url and typed in the terminal `git remote add origin <paste url here>`. Without the <>.
7. We then typed `git push -u origin master` in order to setup the upstream (default) location to origin (repository) master (branch) in github.
